# Vim

  [![Ansible Galaxy](http://img.shields.io/badge/ansible--galaxy-vim-blue.svg)](https://galaxy.ansible.com/list#/roles/6323)

  This is a non opinionated vim config: just install vim and a set of common bundles/plugins. All config, key bindings
  and magical stuff are left to your customizations.

  This role it is compatible with Debian/Ubuntu.

  We provide a cascade of config files to allow you to set your custom settings and install your desired plugins without
  hassle. Check our use cases.


## Use case #1: install for shared usage

  You want to install a custom vim settings and plugins in your remote server. This config is shared between all server
  users, but customized settings for a single user is allowed if you want.

  Set `vim_env` variable to `system` in your playbook.

  The common config is placed in `/etc/vim/vimrc.local` (for settings) and `/etc/vim/vimrc.bundles` (for plugins).

  If you need to overwrite any setting or install new plugins for a selected user, you need to put your settings in
  these files: `~/.vimrc.local` and `~/.vimrc.bundles.local`

  **Important**: by default, plugins are installed for `root` user. In all other users you have to install plugins
  manually with command `vim +PluginInstall`.

  Refer to [Vundle documentation](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) for plugin management.


## Use case #2: install for a single user

  You want to use this ansible role to provision your own laptop and just want a customized vim for your user. All your
  config lives in your `$HOME` path, just like regular vim install.

  Set `vim_env` variable to `user` in your playbook and set `vim_users` variable with a list of users to install vim.

  The common config is placed in `~/vimrc` (for settings) and `~/vimrc.bundles` (for plugins).

  If you need to overwrite any setting or install new plugins for a selected user, you need to put your settings in
  these files: `~/.vimrc.local` and `~/.vimrc.bundles.local`

  Refer to [Vundle documentation](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) for plugin management.
